# Saplyn Android Architecture

This is an app that tracks daily activity in a generic way.  You can post daily
stats for any activity, from running miles to marathoning Gilmore Girls, and it
will give you statistics that are relevant...generically.

# Motivation

This project is a rebuild of the previous stub of an Android application. The project was shelved for a while, during which time Android architecture changed/came into existence. Needless to say, I'm excited to interface with the new components.
